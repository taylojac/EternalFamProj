                        <p class="mb-3">No one is a better example of how to be a good father and husband to Christ. He personified the way we should treat others which directly applies to how we should teach our spouses and children, and family members in general. Christ was diligent in serving others which is exactly how we should be with our families, always ready to help and bless. I think of the story of Christ and the man with palsy where his friends lift him down through the ceiling. Christ helped this man who could not help himself. I have a strong feeling that as fathers in husbands there will be times where our spouse or children will be helpless. They will come to us for help and we need to be ready to succor them and bear burdens with them just like Christ did.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Diligence and Obedience: Jesus emulates all Christ like attributes but the ones I want to focus on is Diligence and His Obedience to the will of the Father. Jesus did everything the Father asked of Him to exactness. He endured the most and suffered the most. In His most agonizing moments He was still obedient to the will of the father and diligent in accomplishing the Fathers Plan. That is what a good father/husband would do. They would be the ultimate example of obedience to God to their family and diligent in doing hard things to help their family.</p>
