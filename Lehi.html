Lehi was a prophet of the Book of Mormon who was warned by God to leave Jerusalem with his family. Lehi had many children, some who followed after him in righteousness and others who turned to wickedness and sin. But throughout Lehiâ€™s life in the Book of Mormon he continually teaches about the Savior to his family. Lehi is an example of a great father and husband because of the  concern and love he had for his family to follow Christ and obtain eternal life.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Knowledge: The Christ like attribute that sticks out to me from the life of Lehi is knowledge. Throughout the life of Lehi he shares the knowledge he had to family. He was constantly concerned for their salvation and shared with them the way to eternal life and to repent. One of The examples of him using the Christ like attribute of knowledge to bless his family is in the beginning of Second Nephi. In this account Lehi teaches and exorts his family of his knowledge and teaches of the fall of Adam and Eve and tells his children to follow Nephi. To me one of the best things a Father can do is to point his children to Christ and this is what Lehi does through the knowledge of the gospel that he had.</p>
