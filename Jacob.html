                        <p class="mb-3">Abraham is known as the “Father of the Faithful.” Abraham is the prophet of the Old Testament who made covenants with God. Abraham was promised that he will have seed numbered as the dust of the Earth. Interestingly enough Abraham only had one son, Isaac. Who he is asked to sacrifice, Abraham is willing to follow the will of the Father and do it but an angel stops him. Abraham is a great father figure because he was an example to his son and wife by being willing to follow God even when it was extremely hard and He raised a great son Isaac in righteousness.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Hope: Abraham really emulates the Christ like attribute of Hope because He was promised the blessings of having a seed as much as the dust of the Earth. He did not live to see that but had one son, Isaac, which his posterity led to Jacob and his 12 sons and continued onward and became many. The bessing came and even though he did not see it in his life I am sure he had hope that it would come to pass.</p>
